# Project - Visualization of Jobs being offered by each company

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Using free resources only

1. Create a SQL database on AWS S3 Bucket ( 5GB free for 12 months)
2. Web Scraping: pull data from **[myvisajobs.com](http://myvisajobs.com)** using the **`Beautifulsoup`** library in python to generate a CSV file
3. Use `Tableau`, for data visualization 
4. Display data on a webpage using the `Streamlit` package along with DASH. ([https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/databases/tableau](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/databases/tableau) )
5. Dockerise the application
6. Deploy it on Heroku / Vercel

## Future Improvements could be:

1. automating the process of collecting data from myvisajobs.com
2. deploy Tableau to streamlit and explain the project with the help of screenshots through out the page.
3. use dash to provide visualizations instead of Tableau by doing complex analysis in python.
4. See if this project requires Machine Learning model. 

## Other Ideas:

1. LinkedIn - Calculating layoffs/hiring percentage using Machine Learning Models
2. Music Recommendation System
3. Build a Chrome Extension for writing notes - auto delete at end of the day - prompt/save
4. Screenshot app, store the image temporarily, and send it to the respective app in the required format
